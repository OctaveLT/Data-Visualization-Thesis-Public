## Abstract

Pediatric obesity is a disease complex to analyze and hard to treat. Therefore, helping and supporting clinicians in curing children is needed. This thesis investigates the value of a clinical  decision support tool to address this issue. The study was carried in Evira company by following the user-centered design thinking method. The user research, carried out with semi-structured
interviews at Martina Barnsjukhuset and Capio VÃ¥rdcentral Zinkensdamm, provided the users needs. Later, after sketching and brainstorming around those requirements, a prototype was imagined and created. Next, this prototype was tested by experts during task-based and semi-structured interviews. This evaluation phase concluded that the prototype was intuitive and effective. A final prototype corrected some of the requests obtained during the evaluation. Further research can still be carried out in order to fine-tune this last prototype.
