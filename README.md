## Abstract

Pediatric obesity is a disease complex to analyze and hard to treat. Therefore, helping and supporting clinicians in curing children is needed. This thesis investigates the value of a clinical  decision support tool to address this issue. The study was carried in Evira company by following the user-centered design thinking method. The user research, carried out with semi-structured
interviews at Martina Barnsjukhuset and Capio VÃ¥rdcentral Zinkensdamm, provided the users needs. Later, after sketching and brainstorming around those requirements, a prototype was imagined and created. Next, this prototype was tested by experts during task-based and semi-structured interviews. This evaluation phase concluded that the prototype was intuitive and effective. A final prototype corrected some of the requests obtained during the evaluation. Further research can still be carried out in order to fine-tune this last prototype.

By using the button in the right-top corner, you have the choice between four period of time (1 month, 3 months, 1 year, 3 years) that will re-update the three top charts accordingly.

### Parallel graph interaction - Zooming & Panning 

You can easily interact with the parallel graph in the right-top corner. You can zoom in or out and pan the scales. In addition to that, you can freeze the current treatment year chosen by clicking. The lines are highlighted or greyed if you hover them or not!

### Patients Activity hover highlighting

Two lines can be compared in each line graph. The green one corresponds to the current year and the one greyed to the last year. Hovering on them will make them hightlighted and greyed for a better visualization.

### Tooltips

All the views come with a tooltip to give details on demand and more additional information about the data hovered such as the median, the current data, ...

<div style={{
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-around;
     }}>

</div>

### Hover titles
The titles of the section maintain short to improve the overall visibility. Nevertheless, hovering on them gives a more specific and detailed title of each section.

<div style={{
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-around;
     }}>
  <img alt="Titles triggers by hovering in the duration between visit component" src="/gifs/visitsTitles.gif" height="250"/>
